# Creating and Configuring Certificates

Setting you cluster up with TLS is an important step towards a secure
deployment. TLS is absolutely necassary and part of our [Security
Model](/docs/internals/security.html). Correctly configuring TLS can be a
complex process however, especially given the wide range of deployment
methodologies. This guide will provide you with a production ready TLS
configuration.

~> More advanced topics like key management and rotation are not covered by this
guide. [Vault][vault] is the suggested solution for key generation and
management.

This guide has the following chapters:

1. [Creating Certificates](#creating-certificates)
1. [Configuring Agents](#configuring-agents)
1. [Configuring the Consul CLI for HTTPS](#configuring-the-consul-cli-for-https)
1. [Configuring the Consul UI for HTTPS](#configuring-the-consul-ui-for-https)

This guide is structured in way that you build knowledge with every step. It is
recommended to read the whole guide before starting with the actual work,
because you can sawe time if you are aware of some of the more advanced things
in Chapter [3](#configuring-the-consul-cli-for-https) and
[4](#configuring-the-consul-ui-for-https).

## Creating Certificates

### Estimated Time to Complete

2 minutes

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have Consul 1.4 (or newer) in your PATH.

### Introduction

The first step to configuring TLS for Consul is generating certificates. In
order to prevent unauthorized cluster access, Consul requires all certificates
be signed by the same Certificate Authority (CA). This should be a _private_ CA
and not a public one like [Let's Encrypt][letsencrypt] as any certificate
signed by this CA will be allowed to communicate with the cluster.

~> Consul certificates may be signed by intermediate CAs as long as the root CA
   is the same. Append all intermediate CAs to the `cert_file`.

### Step 1: Create a Certificate Authority

There are a variety of tools for managing your own CA, [like the PKI secret
backend in Vault][vault-pki], but for the sake of simplicity this guide will
use Consul's builtin TLS helpers:

```shell
$ consul tls ca create
==> Saved consul-ca.pem
==> Saved consul-ca-key.pem
```

The CA certificate (`consul-ca.pem`) contains the public key necessary to
validate Consul certificates and therefore must be distributed to every node
that requires access.

~> The CA key (`consul-ca-key.pem`) will be used to sign certificates for Consul
nodes and must be kept private.

### Step 2: Create individual Server Certificates

Create a server certificate for datacenter `dc1` and domain `consul`, if your
datacenter or domain is different please use the appropriate flags:

```shell
$ consul tls cert create -server
==> WARNING: Server Certificates grants authority to become a
    server and access all state in the cluster including root keys
    and all ACL tokens. Do not distribute them to production hosts
    that are not server nodes. Store them as securely as CA keys.
==> Using consul-ca.pem and consul-ca-key.pem
==> Saved consul-server-dc1-0.pem
==> Saved consul-server-dc1-0-key.pem
```

Please repeat this process until there is an *individual* certificate for each
server. The command can be called over and over again, it will automatically add
a suffix.

In order to authenticate Consul servers, servers are provided with a special
certificate - one that contains `server.dc1.consul` in the `Subject Alternative
Name`. If you enable
[`verify_server_hostname`](/docs/agent/options.html#verify_server_hostname),
only agents that provide such certificate are allowed to boot as a server.
An attacker could otherwise compromise a Consul agent and restart the agent as a
server in order to get access to all the data in your cluster! This is why
server certificates are special, and only servers should have them provisioned.

~> Server certificates, like the CA key, must be kept private!

### Step 3: Create Client Certificates

Create a client certificate:

```shell
$ consul tls cert create -client
==> Using consul-ca.pem and consul-ca-key.pem
==> Saved consul-client-0.pem
==> Saved consul-client-0-key.pem
```

Client certificates are also signed by your CA, but they do not have that
special `Subject Alternative Name` which means that if `verify_server_hostname`
is enabled, they cannot start as a server.

## Configuring Agents

### Prerequisites

For this section you need access to your existing or new Consul cluster and have
the certificates from previous chapter available.

### Notes on example configurations

The example configurations from this as well as the following chapters are in
json. You can copy each one of the examples in its own file in a directory
([`-config-dir`](/docs/agent/options.html#_config_dir)) from where consul will load all the
configuration. This is just one way to do it, you can also put them all into one
file if you prefer that.

### Introduction

By now you have created the certificates you need to enable TLS in your cluster.
The next steps will demonstrate how to configure TLS. However take this with a
grain of salt because turning on TLS might not be that straight forward
depending on your setup. For example in a cluster that is being used in
production you want to turn on TLS step by step to ensure there is no downtime
like described [here][guide].

### Step 1: Setup Consul servers with certificates

This step describes how to setup one of your consul servers, you want to make
sure to repeat the process for the other ones as well with their individual
certificates.

The following files need to be copied to your Consul server:

* `consul-ca.pem`: CA public certificate.
* `consul-server-dc1-0.pem`: Consul server node public certificate for the `dc1` datacenter.
* `consul-server-dc1-0-key.pem`: Consul server node private key for the `dc1` datacenter.

Here is an example agent TLS configuration for Consul servers which mentions the
copied files:

```json
{
  "verify_incoming": true,
  "verify_outgoing": true,
  "verify_server_hostname": true,
  "ca_file": "consul-ca.pem",
  "cert_file": "consul-server-dc1-0.pem",
  "key_file": "consul-server-dc1-0-key.pem"
}
```

After a Consul agent restart, your servers should be only talking TLS.

### Step 2: Setup Consul clients with certificates

Now copy the following files to your Consul clients:

* `consul-ca.pem`: CA public certificate.
* `consul-client-0.pem`: Consul client node public certificate.
* `consul-client-0-key.pem`: Consul client node private key.

Here is an example agent TLS configuration for Consul agents which mentions the
copied files:

```json
{
  "verify_incoming": true,
  "verify_outgoing": true,
  "ca_file": "consul-ca.pem",
  "cert_file": "consul-client-0.pem",
  "key_file": "consul-client-0-key.pem"
}
```

After a Consul agent restart, your agents should be only talking TLS.

## Configuring the Consul CLI for HTTPS

It is possible to disable the HTTP API and only allow HTTPS by setting:

```json
{
    "ports": {
        "http": -1,
        "https": 8501
    }
}
```

If your cluster is configured like that, you will need to create additional
certificates in order to be able to continue to access the API and the UI:

```shell
$ consul tls cert create -cli
==> Using consul-ca.pem and consul-ca-key.pem
==> Saved consul-cli-0.pem
==> Saved consul-cli-0-key.pem
```

If you are trying to get members of you cluster, the CLI will return an error:

```shell
$ consul members
Error retrieving members:
  Get http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/members?segment=_all:
  dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8500: connect: connection refused
$ consul members -http-addr="https://localhost:8501"
Error retrieving members:
  Get https://localhost:8501/v1/agent/members?segment=_all:
  x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

But it will work again if you provide the certificates you provided:

```shell
$ consul members -ca-file=consul-ca.pem -client-cert=consul-cli-0.pem \
  -client-key=consul-cli-0-key.pem -http-addr="https://localhost:8501"
  Node     Address         Status  Type    Build     Protocol  DC   Segment
  ...
```

This process can be cumbersome to type each time, so the Consul CLI also
searches environment variables for default values. Set the following
environment variables in your shell:

```shell
$ export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=https://localhost:8501
$ export CONSUL_CACERT=consul-ca.pem
$ export CONSUL_CLIENT_CERT=consul-cli-0.pem
$ export CONSUL_CLIENT_KEY=consul-cli-0-key.pem
```

* `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` is the URL of the Consul agent and sets the default for
  `-http-addr`.
* `CONSUL_CACERT` is the location of your CA certificate and sets the default
  for `-ca-file`.
* `CONSUL_CLIENT_CERT` is the location of your CLI certificate and sets the
  default for `-client-cert`.
* `CONSUL_CLIENT_KEY` is the location of your CLI key and sets the default for
  `-client-key`.

After these environment variables are correctly configured, the CLI will
respond as expected.

### Note on SANs for Server and Client Certificates

Using `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` as `Subject Alternative Names` in server
and client certificates allows tools like `curl` to be able to communicate with
Consul's HTTPS API when run on the same host. Other SANs may be added during
server/client certificates creation with `-additional-dnsname` to allow remote
HTTPS requests from other hosts.

## Configuring the Consul UI for HTTPS

If your servers and clients are configured now like above, you won't be able to
access the builtin UI anymore. We recommend that you pick a Consul agent you
want to run the UI on and follow the instructions to get the UI up and running
again.

### Step 1: Which interface to bind to?

Depending on your setup you might need to change to which interface you are
binding because thats `127.0.0.1` by default for the UI. Either via the
[`addresses.https`](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options.html#https) or
[client_addr](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options.html#client_addr) option
which also impacts the DNS server. The Consul UI is unproteced which means you
need to put some auth in front of it if you want to make it publicly available!

Binding to `0.0.0.0` should work:

```json
{
  "ui": true,
  "client_addr": "0.0.0.0"
}
```

### Step 2: verify_incoming_rpc

Your Consul agent will deny the connection straight away because `verify_incoming` is enabled.

> If set to true, Consul requires that all incoming connections make use of TLS and that the client provides a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority from the ca_file or ca_path. This applies to both server RPC and to the HTTPS API.

Since the browser doesn't present a certificate signed by our CA, you cannot access the UI. If you `curl` your HTTPS UI the following happens:

```shell
$ curl https://localhost:8501/ui/ -k -I
curl: (35) error:14094412:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert bad certificate
```

This is the Consul HTTPS server denying your connection because you are not presenting a client certificate signed by your Consul CA.
There is a combination of options however that allows us to keep using `verify_incoming` for RPC, but not for HTTPS:

```json
{
  "verify_incoming": false,
  "verify_incoming_rpc": true
}
```

~> This is the only time we are changing the value of the existing option
`verify_incoming` to false. Make sure to change it in the correct place!

With the new configuration, it should work:

```shell
$ curl https://localhost:8501/ui/ -k -I
HTTP/2 200
...
```

### Step 3: Subject Alternative Name

This step will take care of setting up the domain you want to use to access the Consul UI. Unless thats `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` you will have to go through that because it won't work otherwise:

```shell
$ curl https://myconsului.com:8501/ui/ \
  --resolve 'myconsului.com:8501:127.0.0.1' \
  --cacert consul-ca.pem
curl: (51) SSL: no alternative certificate subject name matches target host name 'myconsului.com'
...
```

The above command simulates a request a browser is making when you are trying to use the domain `myconsului.com` to access your UI. This time we do validate the certificates because the browser is doing the same and we also pass the Consul CA. The problem this time is that your domain is not in `Subject Alternative Name` of the Certificate. We can fix that by creating a certificate that has our domain:

```shell
$ consul tls cert create -server -additional-dnsnames myconsului.com
...
```

And if you put your new cert into the configuration of the agent you picked to serve the UI and restart Consul, it works now:

```shell
$ curl https://myconsului.com:8501/ui/ \
  --resolve 'myconsului.com:8501:127.0.0.1' \
  --cacert consul-ca.pem -I
HTTP/2 200
...
```

### Step 4: Trust the Consul CA

So far we have provided curl with our CA so that it can verify the connection, but if we stop doing that it will complain and so will our browser if you are going to your UI on https://myconsului.com:

```shell
$ curl https://myconsului.com:8501/ui/ \
  --resolve 'myconsului.com:8501:127.0.0.1'
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
...
```

You can fix that by trusting your Consul CA (`consul-ca.pem`) on your machine, please use Google to find out how to do that on your OS.

```shell
$ curl https://myconsului.com:8501/ui/ \
  --resolve 'myconsului.com:8501:127.0.0.1' -I
HTTP/2 200
...
```

## Summary

When you completed this guide, your Consul cluster has TLS enabled and is
protected against all sorts of attacks plus you made sure only your servers are
able to start as a server! A good next step would be to read about [ACLs][acl]!
